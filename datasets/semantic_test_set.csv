entailment;If new completed task on todoist then create task on todoist;"this Applet will listen to tasks completed in a project and when a task is completed it will set a due date for a new project. The advantage of this Applet is that other ""save for later"" Applets will only set a due date at the time the task is added. This can quickly lead to a pile up of items all due within a short time span. Ideally this Applet would have put a due date on the reading task item itself, but todoist doesn't expose that as an action, it only lets you create new tasks. So if you already have a reading list (like me) , then a workaround is to make a super project that this Applet will listen to. then you simply check off in two lists -- one in the Applet project to create a new task and one in the other project with your reading items. again, not ideal but it'll work!"
