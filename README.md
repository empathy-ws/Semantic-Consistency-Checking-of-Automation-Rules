# Semantic-Consistency-Checking-of-IFTTT-applets
In this paper, we propose a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)-based model for semantic consistency checking of IFTTT applets. Our model uses pre-trained language representations to learn the semantics of applet components and identifies inconsistencies within the user-defined descriptions associated with applets.
